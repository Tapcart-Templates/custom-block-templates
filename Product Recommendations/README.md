# Product Recommendations (powered by shopify)

## Description
This block allows customers use the Shopify Storefront API in order to pull a carousel of two rows with recommended products. This block is intended for use on the PDP.

## How this block works
1. Block checks the current product id on the pdp
2. Then makes a request to the shopify storefront api
3. This pulls in a list of recommended products
4. From here, a customer and open up a new pdp they wouldn't normally have had access to without going to the menu or search
