## Why Redo + Tapcart?
The Redo + Tapcart integration allows customers to purchase free returns and package protection right from the app, increasing conversion rates and driving revenue for your store. Customers feel more comfortable making online purchases when they know they can make a return if needed, and Redo’s customizable return portal helps merchant’s convert returns into upsell opportunities.

## How to Connect Redo + Tapcart? 

<u>To set up the Redo Integration:</u>
The Redo Integration is available to all our Tapcart Enterprise customers who have the Custom Blocks feature enabled. To set up this integration, you need to have our app installed on your platform. Once installed, simply add a custom block to load the Redo script. This integration enhances your platform's capabilities, providing a seamless user experience.

## Setup Instructions

The integration utilizes custom blocks within Tapcart, enabling the rendering of Redo’s JS script. This script, in turn, renders the Redo toggle to give users the option of selecting free returns and/or package protection.

Step 1: Log into your Tapcart dashboard and navigate to the 'Custom Blocks' section.
Step 2: Choose to add a new custom block.
Step 3: Paste the Redo JS script and HTML block into the corresponding spaces.
Step 4: Replace the placeholder strings at the top of the JS script with store-specific configuration values. Redo can provide these values if you are going through this process yourself.

- **[REQUIRED]** Line 1 (JS) should be replaced by your Shopify Storefront API access token
- **[REQUIRED]** Line 2 (JS) should be replaced by your Shopify store URL
- **[REQUIRED]** Line 3 (JS) should be replaced by your Redo Widget ID found in your Redo Account

Step 5: If desired, adjust the data in the “variable preview values” section of the Settings tab on the right hand side. This will allow the Preview tab to show you what the block will look like and make any style changes desired using the CSS field.
Step 6: Once satisfied with the preview, save the block add it to the desired locations on the PDP and Cart pages of your app. 

## How Does a User Interact with Redo in-app?

The package protection/free returns label will appear on the PDP pages of Redo eligible items. In the cart, the user will be able to toggle Redo on and off.
