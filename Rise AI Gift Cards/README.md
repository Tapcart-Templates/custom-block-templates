## What is Rise.AI
Rise.ai is a strategic re-engagement solution that provides brands and retailers with a unique currency of their own1. Itâ€™s a platform that offers store credit, gift cards, and cashback for Shopify stores.

## Why Rise.AI + Tapcart?
Integrating Rise.AI's Gift Card feature with Tapcart offers a powerful tool for e-commerce businesses. Here's why:

 - Enhanced Shopping Experience: Rise.AI's Gift Card feature allows customers to purchase and send digital gift cards. When integrated with Tapcart's mobile platform, customers can easily buy and send gift cards directly from your mobile app, enhancing the overall shopping experience.

- Increased Sales: Gift cards often lead to higher order values as customers are likely to spend more than the gift card value. By making gift cards available on your mobile app through Tapcart, you can potentially increase sales.

- Customer Acquisition: Gift cards are often given to others as gifts, introducing new customers to your store. By offering this feature on your mobile app, you can attract new customers who received your store's gift card.
