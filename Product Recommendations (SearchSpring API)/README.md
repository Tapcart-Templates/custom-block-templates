# Product Recommendations (SearchSpring API)

## Description
This block allows customers to fetch personalized recommendations configured in the Searchspring Management Console. It is typically used to power product carousels on pdps.

## How this block works
1. Gets the current product on pdp using Tapcart variables.
2. Makes a request to the SearchSpring API using the product id.
3. Gets a list of products.
4. Displays the list of products as a carousel.
