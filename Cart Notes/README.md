# Cart Note block

## What is a Cart Note block
The Cart Gift Note Block is a custom block that resides in the cart view of your Tapcart mobile app. It leverages the cart notes feature, allowing customers to add a personal message or special instructions to their order.

When a customer adds a note, it appears on the Shopify order as a cart note. This can be particularly useful for gift orders, as it allows customers to include a personal message with their gift. The note added by the customer will be visible in the order details within your Shopify admin panel.
