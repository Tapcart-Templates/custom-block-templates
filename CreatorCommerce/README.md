# CreatorCommerce

## Description

CreatorCommerce is a word-of-mouth marketing platform for creating co-branded referral experiences with influencers and customer advocates.

CreatorCommerce helps brands win new customers through co-branded shopping experiences with their influencers & customers advocates.

## Why CreatorCommerce + Tapcart

The CreatorCommerce + Tapcart Integration empowers your brand to capture new revenue by converting app users into affiliates – providing them with a personalized landing page to share with others, along with an in-app tool for cashing out commissions/rewards. Allowing your top retention channel to become an acquisition channel too.

Top customers make for the best affiliates, and where do top customers live? In your Tapcart app! This method of in-app recruitment & referral execution has been seen to boost top-line GMV by 5%-10%, and to double the revenue & conversion rate of your current affiliate programs.

## How to Connect CreatorCommerce + Tapcart?

The CreatorCommerce integration is available to all Tapcart Enterprise customers. For more information on CreatorCommerce, check out their website.

1. To use this integration you’ll need a CreatorCommerce account. To get one you’ll need to install the CreatorCommerce Shopify App.

2. When installed, book an onboarding call with CreatorCommerce to configure your email invitation flows & start a co-branded storefront template.

3. CreatorCommerce requires that you integrate a base affiliate marketing platform (Such as Social Snowball), along with your email marketing CRM (Such as Klaviyo) to use the integration.

## Setup Instructions

The integration will use the CreatorCommerce platform to onboard affiliates, generate co-branded landing pages, and to sync with an base affiliate tracking software for payouts (e.g. Social Snowball).

### Step 1

### Step 2

Obtain your Channel ID for CreatorCommerce. This is the string at the end of your CreatorCommerce dashboard URL (Example: https://dashboard.creatorcommerce.shop/657b65185d6d7743b4ae70c8)

### Step 4

Ensure that app users can reach this page by enabling at least 1, if not both of the following entry points:

- **Access through app navigation** - Add your block to a page from either multi-page menu/bottom menu/side menu navigation. This puts your program font & center, and maximizes exposure. This is recommended if you want to make your program available to any & all app users.

- **Access through account page** - Add a link to your custom page from the accounts menu. This ensures that app users who have signed in can reach your affiliate onboarding experience through the accounts section of your app.

</div>
<!-- end raw HTML -->

### Step 5

Verified customers make for authentic affiliates. You can send a push notification to users who have made a purchase, which will take them to your custom page to learn about and enroll in your CreatorCommerce affiliate program.

- Setup a post-purchase push flow
- Set it to 30min after a purchase
- Send traffic to the page with your affiliate experience

## How Does a User Interact with CreatorCommerce in-app?

### Entry Points

App users can reach the CreatorCommerce program onboarding experience through a post-purchase push notification, account page menu items, or bottom/side menu items. All three solutions will take the user to a page to learn about the program, and to commence onboarding.

</div>
<!-- end raw HTML -->

### Onboarding

During onboarding, users can provide a profile picture, an accent color, reviews of their favorites products, and additional comments about the brand. This information is used to generate a landing page that showcases the unique personality & namesake of the affiliate. Such customizations go a long way to cultivating more shopper trust when the page is shared with others.

</div>
<!-- end raw HTML -->


### On-going Management

Once the co-branded page has been generated, the affiliate can make on-going customizations such as additions of new product recommendations, reviews, and stylistic changes to the page. This can all be done directly in the Tapcart app by returning to the custom page. Once an affiliate has made at least 1 referral, they can also begin a withdrawal of their commissions.

### Considerations 

**What personas should use CreatorCommerce**

Consider if you want to make CreatorCommerce available to all app users, just customers, or just influencers. There’s strategies that can be implemented to better scope access to specific sets of users. There’s no one-size-fits all to a creator-led selling strategy.

**What underlying affiliate platform to use**

Consider the affiliate platform that will be used to power your CreatorCommerce integration. Think of CreatorCommerce as your co-branded selling engine. However, you still need to use an affiliate platform for storing data around your affiliates such as their sales data & commissions-owed. CreatorCommerce also uses your underlying affiliate platform to facilitate payouts in your Tapcart app. Social Snowball is an option to consider if you don’t know where to begin.


## Frequently Asked Questions

**How much work is required on-going?**

None! After onboarding with CreatorCommerce, you can leave everything as-is. The system will run on its own and continue to recruit & motivate creators to refer your products. It’s recommended to update your co-branded storefront templates each quarter.

**What eCommerce categories is CreatorCommerce best suited for?**

CreatorCommerce makes sense for product lines that typically do well with peer-to-peer recommendations or influence. Beauty, fashion, apparel, health, and wellness products are highly susceptible to influence from others, especially from friends & those we trust.

**Do you integrate with influencer or affiliate marketing platforms?**

Yes, an integration with a base affiliate marketing platform is required.

**Is there a trial?**

CreatorCommerce does not offer trials, but does provide launch credits to launch for free if you commit to a collaborative onboarding process.

**How does order attribution work?**

All tracking is UTM-free, Cookie-free, and 100% future-proof. CreatorCommerce orders will show up with a “CreatorCommerce’ order tag in Shopify, and will be displayed in your affiliate marketing tool plus the CreatorCommerce dashboard.

**Can my customers use this, as well as my influencers?**

CreatorCommerce is about providing affiliates with a referral sales channel that best reflects themselves. For influencers this looks like a content-heavy page, and for customers this may look like a simple referral experience. Regardless, CreatorCommerce offers a co-branded experience catered to the unique needs of any persona & participant.

**What does CreatorCommerce cost?**

Pricing is included on CreatorCommerce’s Shopify App listing. Pricing for this integration starts at $99/month. Bear in mind that you will also need to potentially pay for an underlying affiliate management CRM (Such as Social Snowball) if you do not have one already.
